-- How to push your project to git
Create git repo, copy the url
Open your project in Vscode and write

git init
git remote add origin <repo url here> Paste the copied repo url
git remote -v  this will show if your git has be initialized

It will look like this below:
$ origin  git@github.com:your-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
$ origin  git@github.com:your-username/repo-name.git (push)

Next is to add, commit and push your project.

git add .
git commit -m "your commit"
git push -u origin master

* If it your first time, you will require to do this:

git config --global user.email "you@example.com", put your git email address

git config --global user.name "Your Name", put your git name as it is written in your git account then try the process again.
This time, everything should be fine.

To create branch of your git, use the follow command:

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

Remember to commit and push regularly, and give yourself descriptive commit messages so that itâ€™s easy to track the progress of your project, and see where to go back to if you need to revert to a previous state.
